Aeronautical Engineering Course Details
Aeronautical Engineering is the study that involves researching, designing, developing, constructing, maintenance of the aircrafts and spacecrafts within Earth's atmosphere. It also covers the investigation into aerodynamic elements of aircraft, including behaviours and related factors such as control surfaces, lift, airfoil, and drag.

Aeronautical is one of the branch of aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineers are accountable for researching, designing and production of aircraft and spacecraft launching of satellite launch vehicle, defense missiles and satellites for different applications within and outside the atmosphere.

B Tech / BE Aeronautical Engineering Course
Aeronautical Engineering Course of 4 years, there are 8 semesters in which students will get theoretical and practical knowledge. It is one of the best undergraduate programs in the field of aviation and has higher career opportunities. Aeronautical Engineering is one of the most dedicated branches of aerospace engineering that includes the atmosphere. In this course, the candidate will study about design, development, and research of an aircraft. Aircraft is the most modern technology-based flying device, in this, we can find all the latest technologies. So in this course candidate has to learn all types of technology and do lots of research. The main job of an aeronautical engineer is to do research and make aircraft more lightweight and safe for the passengers.

The drone is the latest flying device and is going to most popular and common use. In the Aeronautical Engineering course candidate has to learn about drone technologies.
